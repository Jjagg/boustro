# Paragraphs

Paragraphs in boustro can be split in two categories:

1. Uneditable paragraphs: simple embeds that cannot be changed once inserted in the editor.
   These are easier to create, but provide a worse user experience.
2. Editable paragraphs: embeds that support customization or other changes after insertion in the editor.
