# Contribute to boustro

Boustro is still a very young project that I'm developing for my own
(proprietary) app. I do, however, wish for boustro to become a great
solution for anyone requiring rich text editing capabilities in their
Flutter app.

Bug fixes or small improvements are welcome. For design discussions or
feature requests, please open an [issue](https://github.com/Jjagg/boustro/issues).
